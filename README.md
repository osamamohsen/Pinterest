# Mvil Image Loader
Mvil is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface. Mvil primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Mvil is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.
